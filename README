An initial SWIG-based Lua binding for fontforge.
The binding is based on 
fontforge commit nr. 6f0f5a54c56f56a2b38df032e1bb95f1f11c56ee,
with freetype 2.4.9 .
The goal is to add another scripting language (Lua) to fontforge as the native one and Python, and not
to add a Lua interpreter to FontForge --- basically it'a a Lua estension and not a FontForge extension.

You need to have fontforge and Lua with development files (lib & header).
If necessary, compile and install the source under /opt/fontforge 

The Lua script 
svg2otf.lua
take an OTF font of mine (Concrete.otf) and makes an svg without error --- which doesn't mean that
the otf and svg  files are ok.
